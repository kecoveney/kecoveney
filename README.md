## Hey there, I'm Kat! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a full-stack developer diving deep into the world of software with a background in gaming, TTRPGs, and storytelling. Inspired by a family legacy in tech, Iâ€™ve taken a unique path into developmentâ€”one that combines a love for creativity with the logical rigor of code.

Starting my career journey in software development, I discovered that building projects is more than just writing code; itâ€™s about bringing ideas to life, solving real-world challenges, and sharing tools with a community. From constructing fantasy adventure platforms to game-tracking websites, I thrive on projects that allow me to combine my love for storytelling with my passion for tech.

After years of immersing myself in fantasy worlds and learning the ropes of game mechanics, Iâ€™m now channeling those experiences into software projects like **QuestScribe**, an interactive platform for TTRPG and fantasy enthusiasts to document and collaborate on adventures. This platform, along with my other projects, is a testament to the ways I believe tech can inspire creativity and community.

I look forward to continuously honing my skills, learning new tools, and exploring how software can solve problems and make an impact.
